## Welcome to Command Line Hangman!

### Hello! Thanks for checking this out. Here I have created a command line version of hangman using node.js and a the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [random-word](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-word) packages  from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

### This version of hangman has several exciting features!
* selects a random word and allows a specific number of guess attempts for each of the word's letters
* get points for guessing correctly
* lose points for failing
* save favorite words in an array attached to the username
* stores user data (points, name, favorite words array)

### How do I play?

1. go ahead and clone this respository! `git clone git@github.com:xezian/command-line-hangman.git`
2. once you have cloned this git repo run `npm install` from the same directory you cloned
3. then run the game by calling `node main.js` from the command line.

### Technical details

* Makes extensive use of modular composition
* Makes extensive use of constructor functions
* Has a really good time with JSON objects

### Where is this going?

* I have a few ideas for additional functionality which I may implement in the future. 
* For me, this is more of an exercise in coding than anything, in an attempt to develop my skills as a developer.
* On that note, I appreciate any feedback or communication about the game itself or (even better) my code, including any ideas about how I can improve either.

## Thanks for swinging by, 
## and hang in there.
